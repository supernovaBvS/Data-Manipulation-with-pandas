Write Code\nAfter running the cell above, you have created four pandas DataFrames: `avocado`, `homelessness`, `temperatures`, and `walmart`. \n\n**Add code** to the code cells below to try one (or more) of the following challenges:\n\n1. Print the highest weekly sales for each `department` in the `walmart` DataFrame. Limit your results to the top five departments, in descending order. If you're stuck, try reviewing this [video](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas/aggregating-dataframes?ex=1).\n2. What was the total `nb_sold` of organic avocados in 2017 in the `avocado` DataFrame? If you're stuck, try reviewing this [video](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas/slicing-and-indexing-dataframes?ex=6).\n3. Create a bar plot of the total number of homeless people by region in the `homelessness` DataFrame. Order the bars in descending order. Bonus: create a horizontal bar chart. If you're stuck, try reviewing this [video](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas/creating-and-visualizing-dataframes?ex=1).\n4. Create a line plot with two lines representing the temperatures in Toronto and Rome. Make sure to properly label your plot. Bonus: add a legend for the two lines. If you're stuck, try reviewing this [video](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/data-manipulation-with-pandas/creating-and-visualizing-dataframes?ex=1).\n\nBe sure to check out the **Answer Key** at the end to see one way to solve each problem.
